# FoodTruckProject


#Overview
The Food Truck rating application uses an input method to allow users to enter name and 
food type for a truck and then rate it.  I allow 5 trucks to be rated at a time. 
Once the input is received the user can then choose from a menu of options such as; display all trucks, 
get the average rating, or find the highest rated truck.
Once the user no longer wishes to continue they can quit and the applicaiton is complete.

#Lessons Learned
The first thing i did was start by trying to build all the loops before building any trucks.
After 3 or 4 hours of trying to loop nothing i scratched the project and started over.  This 
time using grandma app as a reference to understand how to build a truck. Things started to fall into place after that.
I got stuck on the increment id and learned it takes 2 varaibles to make that work.
Finally the highest truck i had out of order and incorrect.  I learned that i needed to check for null, and then assign to an actual truck.
